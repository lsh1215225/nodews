                    <div class="article-meta">
                        By Ford Prefect | Galactic Researcher
                    </div>
                    <div class="article-body">
                        <p>Early this morning, at four o'clock in the morning local time, Earth was completely demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass in what can only be described as a regrettable administrative error. The demolition notice had been delivered to the local planetary administration department six months ago, but due to an address error, it was delivered to an abandoned furniture shop in South London instead.</p>
                        
                        <p>When asked for comment on the incident, a spokesperson for the Galactic Planning Commission stated: "We deeply regret this unfortunate mistake. We have arranged alternative accommodation for those affected. It's worth noting, however, that most of Earth's inhabitants had already left the planet before this incident occurred."</p>
                        
                        <p>Arthur Dent, the only surviving Earthling, recalls being sat outside his house, which was about to be demolished, protesting against local town planning. "I was sitting in front of the bulldozer trying to stop them from demolishing my house," said Mr. Dent, "and then I realized they were actually demolishing the entire planet. It really put things in perspective."</p>
                        
                        <p>Mr. Dent is now traveling across the galaxy with his alien friend Ford Prefect, who happens to be the spokesperson for an electronic book known as "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." The Guide is a comprehensive and somewhat unreliable travel manual to the galaxy, known for its accurate and practical advice – though occasionally marred by obvious errors and contradictory recommendations.</p>
                        
                        <p>According to reliable sources, Earth had been considered one of the most uninteresting planets in the galaxy before its demolition. This honor has now been transferred to a planet called "The Pit of Meaninglessness" on the edge of the galaxy, where the inhabitants do nothing but queue up for things, and they're very good at it.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Company advises all residents to remain calm under all circumstances and remember the most important piece of advice: "DON'T PANIC." This phrase is printed on the cover of every Guide in large, friendly letters so that passengers can see it clearly even in moments of despair.</p>

                    <div class="article-meta">
                        By Trillian Astra | Political Correspondent
                    </div>
                    <div class="article-body">
                        <p>In the upcoming Galactic Presidential election, leading candidate Zaphod Beeblebrox has promised to dramatically improve the galaxy's hyperspace road system if elected. "I'm fed up with seeing so many planets accidentally demolished due to faulty hyperspace planning," Mr. Beeblebrox stated in an interview. "We need a smarter system."</p>
                        
                        <p>His main opponent, former Galactic Transport Minister Cornelius Foulk, criticized Beeblebrox's plan as being too expensive. "We shouldn't be spending thousands of billions of Altarian dollars to solve what is essentially a relatively minor problem," said Mr. Foulk. "Most planets have plenty of time to relocate."</p>
                        
                        <p>The race remains tight, with many citizens still undecided about which candidate offers the best solution to the galaxy's ongoing transportation infrastructure problems. Polls indicate that voters are particularly concerned about the safety of hyperspace travel following the recent increase in planetary demolition incidents.</p>

                    <p>"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is more than just a book – it's one of the most important technological devices in the galaxy. The electronic edition of this guide contains detailed information about every planet, every civilization, and every tea shop in the galaxy.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is important to note that the first rule of the Guide is: "DON'T PANIC." This advice proves especially important when faced with the absurdity of the universe.</p>
                    
                    <p>Legend has it that this guide was written by a completely rational yet extremely pessimistic race known as the Vogons, who spent 7.5 million years figuring out the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything. The answer: 42.</p>
